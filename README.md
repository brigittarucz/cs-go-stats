# Scope

The focus of this code repository is data processing and manipulation. There could be many different ways to improve the UI, generate statistics, however I have placed a greater emphasis on showcasing the method rather than having a full solution. (explicitly, `DataController.ts`, `RawDataManager.ts`, `server.ts`, `UserStatsManager.ts`)

## Installation

In order to get started run `yarn install` at the root of the repository.

#### Workflow

- In order to process the `game.txt` run `yarn start` which ensures the latest build is available. 
- Afterwards `cd` into `server\build` and run `node cli.js`. 

#### Raw data processing

At the moment of writing, the relevant lines are extracted out of `game.txt` and can be viewed in `historical.json`. In order to be able to view the command in action, replace the content of `historical.json` with `historical.empty.json`, then run it. 

### Stats object structure

```
{
    initTeamCT: string[],
    initTeamT: string[],
    initTeams: {
        CT: string, 
        T: string
    },
    rounds: [
        {
            date: string,
            score: string,
            roundsPlayed: number,
            reasonWin: string
        }
    ],
    userStatsMain: {
        playerUsername: {
            assistedKilling: {
                playerUsernameAssistKilled: {
                    times: number
                } 
            },
            attacked: {
                playerUsernameAttacked: {
                    times: number,
                    with: [
                        {
                            weapon: string,
                            damage: number,
                            hitgroup string
                        }
                    ]
                }
            },

            bombsPlanted: number
            killed: {
                playerUsernameKilled: {
                    headshots: number,
                    times: number,
                    weapons: string[]
                }
            },
